						<h2>What is Shoot Contact Sharing?</h2>
						Shoot Contact Sharing is an app that enables you to quickly curate your contact information into different profiles you can share in seconds via your smartphone. For most of us, the information we need to share with a colleague from work is different from what we might share with our family and close friends. Shoot Contact Sharing makes it possible to create profiles that suit all the unique situations and scenarios where you share your info the most quickly and easily.
					</p>
				<br />
					<a name="free"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>Is Shoot Contact Sharing free?</h2>
						Shoot Contact Sharing is free to use and completely ad free! There is an in-app purchase (for iOS users) and unlocker app (android users) if you want have multiple company names, multiple titles and the ability to have a custom signature or none at all. Upgrading is totally optional but every cent of your purchase goes towards our afternoon candy stash but more importantly, towards helping us make ongoing improvements to Shoot.
					</p>
					<br />
					<a name="digital"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>Is Shoot Contact Sharing like a digital business card app?</h2>
						We’d say that it’s much more powerful than just a digital business card app. Shoot Contact Sharing was developed to be the most flexible tool to help you organize and share your information in any number of different situations, not just for ones where you might send someone the info on your business card.
					</p>
					<br />
					<a name="replace"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>Is Shoot Contact Sharing supposed to replace my paper business cards?</h2>
						Traditional business carry a lot of value for some people and we admit we've seen some pretty cool cards ourselves – <a href="http://www.boredpanda.com/creative-business-card-designs/">like these</a>. If you currently use your business cards to communicate something unique and important about what you do then you shouldn’t necessarily stop. In your case you might just use Shoot Contact Sharing in situations when you can't hand someone a physical card or when it might not be socially appropriate. But if it’s the case where you’re aren’t married to a physical business card Shoot Contact Sharing might be an ideal way to give people your info and at the same time get theirs so it’s easier for you to connect with them later.
						<br /><br />
						Some people have told us that they meet more and more people who don't want to accept paper cards because they lose them and just prefer to receive information digitally. One of these people could be <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/08/business-card-m.html">Seth Godin</a> who said:
						<br /><br />
						<span class="FaqQuote">"After all, I can get your info into my computer a lot quicker if you'll just email it to me."</span><br />
						If you are someone who likes to have paper (or plastic, or wood, or metal) business cards, we recommend checking out Seth’s article on business card mistakes before you hit that ‘submit order' button. And if you end up going for paper, we would definitely agree that <a href="https://www.moo.com/us/">Moo</a> is awesome!

					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>Can I just keep using my paper business cards?</h2>
						Of course, but just don't watch <a href="http://vooza.com/videos/honest-business-card-exchange/">this video</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZVkW9p-cCU&feature=youtu.be">this video.</a>

					<p class="ansPar">
						<h2>Is Shoot Contact Sharing another social network or messaging app?</h2>
						No! No friending, poking, tagging or instant messaging here, productivity only!
					</p>
					<br />
					<a name="name"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>How did you come up with the name?</h2>
						We wanted a name that is easy to remember, short, screams speed and starts with the letter 's'! (ok just kidding on the last one). Late one evening after a brainstorm someone on the team said, 'Everyone shoot me all of your ideas and I'll create a big list.' And that was it.

					<a name="work"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>How does Shoot Contact Sharing work?</h2>
						The main thing to understand about Shoot Contact Sharing your Main Profile. Your Main Profile is like home base where you add all the info you might want to share with someone. This could include everything from phone numbers, email addresses, website URL's, links to your social media profiles and so on. You can also add images. There's no limit on how much or how little information you need to include so it's totally up to you. You can come back to edit your Main Profile anytime so there's no pressure to add everthing at once.
						<br /><br />
						Once you've setup your Main Profile the hard work is done, you can move on to adding new profiles.
					</p>
					<br />
					<a name="should"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>Who should use Shoot Contact Sharing?</h2>
						Shoot Contact Sharing was designed to be super flexible so that anyone can use it in any number of ways.
						<br /><br />
						We’ve heard from a lot of people and as of today the people using Shoot Contact Sharing include:

						<br />
						While diverse, all these people have one thing in common – rather than just passively sending their information to someone, these people are using Shoot Contact Sharing as a tool to proactively make new connections and contacts and achieve their goals, whatever they might be.
						<br /><br />
						We think Andy Ellwood (founder of startup lab <a href="http://exosphe.re/">Exosphere</a>) said it best in this article from <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andyellwood/2012/08/15/why-i-only-carry-one-business-card/">Forbes</a>,
						<br /><br />
						<span class="FaqQuote">"It doesn't matter if they have my contact information, I need theirs...Whenever you meet someone that you would like to build a relationship with, you always want to make sure that you keep the ball in your court and be the one moving that conversation along. There is nothing worse than hearing someone say, 'I gave them my business card but they never called. Oh well.'"</span>
						<br />
						Amen Andy.

					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>Who shouldn't use Shoot Contact Sharing?</h2>
						If you're looking for an app that takes your information and turns it into a fancy design replica of your paper business card in 10 different colors then Shoot Contact Sharing is probably not for you.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<a name="difficult"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>Is Shoot Contact Sharing difficult to use?</h2>
						We don't think so. We test everything out on our parents just to be sure so we're pretty confident that if they can use it you'll be able to too.
					</p>
					<br />
					<a name="watch"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>Does Shoot Contact Sharing work with Apple Watch?</h2>
						Yes. You can easily select a profile and how you want to share it right from your Apple Watch. Shoot Contact Sharing uses one of Apple's new Continuity features released part of Yosemite called Handoff that enables the Watch to integrate with iOS 8 devices over Bluetooth LE and Wi-Fi.
						<br /><br />
						If you're new to using third-party apps on your Apple Watch you can find info from <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204784">Apple Support here</a>.
						<br /><br />
						If you need help enabling Handoff on your iPhone, check out <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/236321/how-to-enable-handoff-on-your-apple-watch">this easy step-by-step</a>.

					<br />
					<p class="FaqCategory">Setting up and creating profiles</p>
					<a name="why"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>Why do I need to create an account?</h2>
						Creating an account makes it possible to save profile info to our secure cloud servers so that you won’t lose your info if you have to change devices. If you have an account you can also have your Shoot Contact Sharing account synced across multiple devices so you’re always up to date.
					</p>
					<br />
					<a name="how"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>How do I create an account?</h2>
						All you need to create an account is a valid email address.
					</p>
					<br />
					<a name="difference"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>What’s the difference between the options 'Import’ and 'Add myself'?</h2>
						If you use an iPhone you can choose between one of two ways to add your contact info to your Main Profile:
						</br></br>
						<div>
							<span class="Blue">•</span>
							<p class="Answer-Bullet">
								'Import' option - if you've setup 'My Card' in your iPhone Apple contacts app, using this option will open your address book and let you select your contact card and automatically import any info you’ve saved there.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<span class="Blue">•</span>
							<p class="Answer-Bullet">
								'Add myself' option - if you go with this option the dialog box will close and you can start to enter your info. Remember that you don't have to add everything at once, you can come back anytime.
							</p>
						</div>
						<br />
						Once you've added some info and save your Main Profile the hard work is done, you can move on to adding new profiles.
						<br /><br />
						If you have an Android smartphone it will automatically import your info for you so you don’t even have to deal with this question : )
					</p>
					<br />
					<a name="setup"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>I’ve set up my Main Profile but it looks like I can add additional profiles, why is that?</h2>
						Creating additional profiles is where you'll really start to get the most from Shoot Contact Sharing. Use additional profiles to create smaller groups of curated information to use in specific situations or purposes. You might create a profile for the information you use for your business and another for personal contact information that you only use with family and close friends.
					</p>
					<br />
					<a name="additional"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>How do I add an additional profile?</h2>
						You've already done the hard work so creating an additional profile is super easy.
						<br /><br />
						 <div>
							<span class="Blue">1</span>
							<p class="Answer-Bullet padding-top-3px">
								From the Main Profile home screen, just tap the '+' icon in the top right corner of the screen.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<span class="Blue">2</span>
							<p class="Answer-Bullet padding-top-3px">
								On the page that appears enter a name for your new profile in the 'Profile Name' field; this could be something like 'Work'.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<span class="Blue">3</span>
							<p class="Answer-Bullet padding-top-3px">
								Underneath the Profile Name you will see all the info you added to your Main Profile but in an uneditable format. To add info to your new Profile, just tap the checkmarks next to what you want to include, when you see it turn green it means it has been added to your new profile.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<span class="Blue">4</span>
							<p class="Answer-Bullet padding-top-3px">
								Then ‘Save’!
							</p>
						</div>
						<br />
						 There's no need to retype anything. Shoot Contact Sharing makes it easy so that once you've added a piece of information to your Main Profile, it's instantly available as an option you can add to any of your additional profiles simply but tapping to select it.
					</p>
					<br />
					<a name="type"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>Why can't I type anything into an additional profile?</h2>
						Shoot Contact Sharing was designed to eliminate the need to enter the same information in multiple places and as well as the hassle of keeping it up to date in each one. With Shoot Contact Sharing you add everything once to your Master Profile and from here it becomes part of a central repository for all your info. When you select info to include in another profile, it simply copies it from your Main Profile. In this way you can add a piece of info to multiple profiles and if you ever need to change it, you only have to do it in one place (your Main Profile) and it will update automatically across any profiles that you’ve added it to.
					</p>
					<br />
					<a name="howmany"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>How many additional profiles can I create?</h2>
						As many as you want, there's no limit to the number of profiles you can create. You could create profiles for your dog, cat and even your iguana – if you iguana.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p class="FaqCategory">Shoot your info</p>
					<a name="ways"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>What ways can I 'Shoot' my information?</h2>
						You can 'Shoot' a profile via email, SMS text message as well as via most messaging apps. Here a list of ways you can ‘Shoot’ a profile to someone:
						<br /><br />
						<div>
							<span class="Blue">•</span>

						<h2>Can I ‘Shoot’ a profile as a vCard?</h2>
						Yes. From the ‘Shoot’ options screen, just select one of the vCard options and Shoot Contact Sharing will automatically create a vCard out of the information in that profile.

					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>If I want to ‘Shoot’ a profile to someone do they need to have Shoot Contact Sharing as well?</h2>
						Nope. This is one of the great things about Shoot Contact Sharing, you can use it to ‘Shoot’ a profile to anyone with a smartphone, the receiver does not need to have the app.
					</p>
					<br />
					<a name="see"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>What does the other person receive when I 'Shoot' them one of my profiles?</h2>
						When you 'Shoot' someone a profile it's sent either in simple text format or as a vCard if you select the vCard option. Shoot Contact Sharing does not add any fancy designs or styles to your message that could be interpreted by the receiver's email as junk. This way your message will always reach the recipient's email box. Because the info is in plain text, it also makes it easy to read and search for whenever they might need to find your message in their inbox. And of course, if you use the vCard option, the recipient will be able to easily import the info you sent into their address book.

						<h2>Does Shoot Contact Sharing support 3D Touch Quick Actions for iPhone 6S?</h2>
						Yes, Shoot Contact Sharing supports Quick Actions now letting you 'Shoot' a profile even faster right from your Home screen. Simply press the Shoot Contact sharing app icon from the Home screen and select the profile you want to 'Shoot'. You'll be taken directly to the screen where all you need to do is select the way you want to 'Shoot' it.

					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>What does the ‘Shoot a Friend’s Info’ feature do?</h2>
						The ‘Shoot a Friend’s Info’ feature enables you to ‘Shoot’ info from your contacts in a similar way to how you would ‘Shoot’ one of your profiles to someone.
					</p>
					<br />
					<a name="situation"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>In what situations would I use this feature?</h2>
						You could use this feature in any situation where you might want to share parts of info from one of your address book contacts. Similar to when you create an additional profile, the ‘Share a Friend’s Info’ feature allows you to select and send only the info that you want to share from your contacts. So for example say you have a long-time friend and you have both their work and personal contact info in your address book. With the ‘Share a Friend’s Info’ feature you can just select their name and work email address to ‘Shoot’ to someone.

					<a name="vcardfriend"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>Can I ‘Shoot a Friend’s Info’ as a vCard too?</h2>

					<p class="FaqCategory">Accessibility</p>
					<a name="technical"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>Are there any technical requirements to use Shoot Contact Sharing?</h2>
						If you have a smartphone we're almost positive you can use Shoot Contact Sharing. But more specifically, here are the technical requirements:
						<br /><br />
						<div>
							<span class="Blue">•</span>
							<p class="Answer-Bullet">
								iPhone or iPod touch running iOS 7 or higher
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<span class="Blue">•</span>
							<p class="Answer-Bullet">
								Android smartphone running Ice Cream Sandwich (version 4.0) or higher
							</p>
						</div>
						<br />
						You can also use Shoot Contact Sharing on most tablet devices as well although the display will be slightly scaled down.
					</p>
					<br />
					<a name="personal"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>Does Shoot Contact Sharing need access to my personal information?</h2>
						No. Shoot Contact Sharing works by simply passing the profile info your want to ‘Shoot’ to whatever app you choose to send it with. Because it's just a hand-off, there's no need for you to share your other account information with us.
						</br></br>
						The only stuff Shoot Contact Sharing requires access to is your smartphone's address book (if you want to import your profile data or use the 'Share a Friend's Info' feature). If you want to add photos to your profile you will need to allow the app to access to your photos like any other app but this is optional.
					</p>
					<br />
					<a name="sell"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>Will Shoot Contact Sharing sell or share my info?</h2>
						No way, this is not cool. Shoot Contact Sharing only wants to help YOU share your info.
					</p>
					<br />
					<a name="multiple"></a>
					<p class="ansPar Faq-MobileHeadersFix">
						<h2>Can I use Shoot Contact Sharing on multiple devices?</h2>

						<h2>What if I want to change my account email?</h2>
						Right now you cannot change the email address you used to create your account.

You can then just delete the old one or leave it active in case you want to access it again in the future.
